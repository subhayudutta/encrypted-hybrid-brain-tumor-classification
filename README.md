# Homomorphic-Hybrid-Brain-Tumor-Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a framework that integrates **homomorphic encryption** with **deep learning** to ensure data privacy while maintaining high classification performance. It combines CNN-based image features with block-level statistical descriptors to enhance tumor detection accuracy.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The model is trained and evaluated on the [Kaggle Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).
